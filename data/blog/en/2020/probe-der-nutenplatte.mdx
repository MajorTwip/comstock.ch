summary: "Shortly before finishing work, I wanted to examine the delivery from Motedis.ch. Since the length of the CNC is adapted to the standard lengths of the AliExpress-KUS, a continuous work surface cannot be created with the standard profiles. There remains a 20mm gap that I somehow still need to close."

Shortly before finishing work, I wanted to examine the delivery from Motedis.ch. Since the length of the CNC is adapted to the standard lengths of the AliExpress-KUS, a continuous work surface cannot be created with the standard profiles. There remains a 20mm gap that I somehow still need to close.

Used here are 6 profiles 30x120 Groove B6 600mm and one 30x60.
