summary: "After driving the first meters yesterday, I consider the side walls (portal cheeks) a success. But the POM-C is too soft after all. I originally thought that 22mm would be stable enough, but the servos bend the cheeks effortlessly. I discovered this when I had swapped the plugs of the servo controls, causing the X-axis to try homing at the Y-axis end stop."

Through the Discord server of End CNC, I found someone who will mill the cheeks for me from finely milled 20mm aluminum. Thanks in advance!
