summary: "Due to my relocation, I gave away my Shapeoko earlier than planned. So I didn't get to mill the loose bearings. I actually thought I would make up for this first with the CNC MK3. However, the loose ends of the KUS swing up too quickly, which is why I quickly made provisional loose bearings from scrap."
