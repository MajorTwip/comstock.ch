Without many words, here are a few iterations of the T-Virus and antidote from Resident Evil which I used for my old cosplay.

The first variant was made with hardware store items, plugs for drainage pipes and silicone tubing. After 2 months, the tubes became milky...

Second variant with Plexy tubes. Heated in the oven at 120 Â°C and then wrapped around a broom handle. Burned fingers, mediocre result.

Variant 3 then with 3D-printed caps.
