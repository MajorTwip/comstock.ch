summary: "Finally completed an old project. The edge where the paving stones meet the wall had been filled with gravel for a year, which looked mediocre but worked. However, the children kept playing with the gravel, and visually it bothered me long enough. Measure, draw, cut, and then lay. I cut with a cheap angle grinder and a diamond blade, which works like cutting through butter."

Trimmed paving stones

Additionally, like last year, I sealed the joints with MEM joint sand. This sand-resin mixture works quite well, although it does wash out a little and some moss still grows. However, much less than without it.
