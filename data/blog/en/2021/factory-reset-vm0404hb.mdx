To map the various PCs and systems to the different screens, I acquired an Aten 4x4 4k HDMI matrix online. Affordable as it was a customer return.

With the default password administrator / password, I could not log in either via the WebGUI or via telnet, even after the "reset" command via RS232, which according to the manual should restore the factory settings.

Through support, I then found out that only the "clearallsetting" command also resets user/password. This command is not described in the manual.

So for others who are unsuccessfully googling, here are a few tags:
