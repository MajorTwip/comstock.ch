At a motocross event, I once saw a professional drone, an octocopter. Research revealed that these were virtually unaffordable... So I immediately ordered motors and accessories from dx.com and started programming...

Implementing Euler angles and PID controllers into an Arduino Mega 2865 wasn't easy. In the end, it was the ESC-motor combinations that caused the project to fail. These were designed for model aircraft and not for such rapid changes in rotation speed. But they would have had 16kg payload capacity...

Later I found a project online that used Nintendo Wii nunchucks (or something similar) as 9 DOF sensors. Would have saved me a lot of time.
