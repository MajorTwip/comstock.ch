In the post [here](/en/blog/2021/meine-erste-cnc) I show my first CNC that I built almost decades ago. And in [these posts](http://www.comstock.ch/category/aktuelle-projekte/cnc-v3/) I show the newest one, the Mk3. But I built this new one partly with the Mk2, or at least with knowledge gained from it.

This second CNC was a kit, a Shapeoko from [myhobby-cnc](https://shop.myhobby-cnc.de/bausaetze/fraesen/6/shapeoko2-kit?c=12).

The GRBL board ran stably after I properly grounded the stepper cables. Before that, the limit switches would falsely trigger frequently.

With this mill I actually only milled 2-3 things, the [CNC Mk3](http://www.comstock.ch/category/aktuelle-projekte/cnc-v3/) as well as the two PCs Seneca and Seneca II.
