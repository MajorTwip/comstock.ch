summary: About 15 years ago, I built my first CNC. It consisted almost exclusively of materials from the hardware store. I found the stepper set with driver board for the LTP parallel port on eBay. AliExpress wasn't known back then.

About 15 years ago, I built my first CNC. It consisted almost exclusively of materials from the hardware store. I found the stepper set with driver board for the LTP parallel port on eBay. AliExpress wasn't known back then.

A PC with EMC2 served as the controller. Does that still exist?

I hardly used this CNC. Thanks to the plastic rollers, which were anything but precise, it milled waves instead of flat surfaces on all axes.
