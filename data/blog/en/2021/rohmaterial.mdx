summary: "Today the first raw materials arrived. Acrylic plates, already cut to size and polished. One 5mm and one 10mm plate will form a platform. Now I can start drawing. Actually, I could have started already... But I have time and would prefer to use iterative rapid prototyping rather than planning forever and then building according to blueprints."
