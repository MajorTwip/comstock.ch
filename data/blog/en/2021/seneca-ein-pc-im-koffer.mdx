summary: An Intel I5 6600k, GTX1070, a bit of RAM... nothing special. Except that the PC is built into a suitcase. And water-cooled. And most of the water channels are milled. And the PC can be clamped to the tabletop in an elevated position.

An Intel I5 6600k, GTX1070, a bit of RAM... nothing special. Except that the PC is built into a suitcase. And water-cooled. And most of the water channels are milled. And the PC can be clamped to the tabletop in an elevated position.

The water channels consist of 4x 3mm acrylic plates, milled on the CNC Mk2 and then glued together. They were never 100% watertight; gluing acrylic over a large area to be watertight and without bubbles is difficult and I didn't quite succeed. Then came Corona, no more LAN parties, no show-off. So I'm using the time for Seneca 3 (Seneca 2 was never completed).
