summary: "Suddenly nothing worked: the LUNs were gone and the servers would not boot. Where is my data?"
draft: true
---

# Starting point
To run an experimental platform I received a pre-configured NetApp. There is no support for it. Until now I had never worked with NetApp or any other SAN.
This NetApp primarily serves an HPE DL380 G10 which boots ESXi from a LUN on the NetApp. Suddenly nothing worked, the NetApp was off. First thought: power outage?
So, boot.
I connected both nodes via Micro-USB cable and used PuTTY on COM20 and COM21 at 115200 baud.

And yes, disks are obviously broken!

Now Node B seems to be in better shape:

After the reboot, unfortunately everything was still the same. I tried an older backup.

These approaches were now open:
```
varfs_backup_restore: bootarg.abandon_varfs is set! Skipping /var backup.
```
This is probably due to the backup restore.
But this?

### Using the spare disk
A spare disk is available (I am surprised it is not automatically added to the aggregate). First I tried replacing a broken disk with the spare. No luck.
```
netapp05::> storage disk replace -disk 1.5.6 -replacement 1.5.1 -action start
Error: command failed: Disk "1.5.6" is not in present state.
```
Ok, try to temporarily reactivate the disks:
```
netapp05::> set advanced

netapp05::*> disk unfail -disk 1.5.9

So 1.5.9 is currently running (but I do not trust it), 1.5.12 stays dead, and 1.5.6 is doing something...

## Moving from an old NetApp
To replace the broken disks I used drives from another NetApp. The disks are identical, same product number.
But that disk was not cleanly removed and cannot be read just like that:

Errors:
The node is configured with All-Flash Optimized personality and this disk is not an SSD. The disk needs to be removed from the system.
```

After a lot of searching I found out that this indicates self-encrypting disks (SED). Fortunately I still had access to the old cluster and could reinsert the disk there. The two volumes on those disks were moved (likely not needed anymore, but you never know) using `volume move` to the remaining aggregates, then the old SAS aggregate was deleted. After plenty of trial and error, the following steps finally worked:
```
set d
node run netapp-master-01 -command disk remove_ownership 0a.00.0P1
node run netapp-master-01 -command disk remove_ownership 0a.00.0P2
node run netapp-master-01 -command disk remove_ownership 0a.00.0

system node run -node netapp-master-01 disk unpartition 0a.00.0

```
So now the disk was finally marked as spare and open, and the new cluster recognized it.

```
storage disk assign -disk 1.5.2 -owner netapp05-01 -data

Now this disk only has to replace the FAILED slot in the aggregate. That seems to happen automatically.

# Fixing the LUN

## Starting point
After the cluster and the aggregates were back up, the servers connected via iSCSI still refused to start. The SMB share was reachable... interesting.

## Bring online
In the NetApp web GUI the IOPS peaks showed up every 5 seconds, every time the server attempted to boot and then reported "no bootable device".
Under the LUN actions I found the option "bring online", which immediately returned an alert:
**The volume is in nvfailed state**

After a quick search I found:
https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/OHW/OHW-KBs/lun_online_fails_with_Error_The_volume_is_in_nvfailed_state
