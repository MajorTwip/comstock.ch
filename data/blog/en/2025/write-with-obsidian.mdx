VSCode is fine, but for authoring md or mdx files it is only so-so. Obsidian seems quite useful. How do I get the data from Obsidian into Contentlayer?

I found the following article:
[Next.js blog with Obsidian as CMS](https://www.neilmathew.co/posts/nextjs-blog-with-obsidian-as-cms)

I opened the repo root as a vault in Obsidian. I hid all folders except "public" and "data" using the community plugin [File Explorer Plus](obsidian://show-plugin?id=file-explorer-plus). To view .mdx files I use [Edit MDX](obsidian://show-plugin?id=edit-mdx).

Following the recommendation from the article, I also use [Paste Image Rename](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-paste-image-rename)
