summary: "The children's room is rather small. With a second bed in standard size, it would have become very cramped. So I needed a solution. To gain space, I built a bunk bed. The existing bed serves as the lower bunk. The rails from the old IKEA toddler bed were reused. The entire bed is anchored to the wall with 2 screws and is self-supporting."

The children's room is rather small. With a second bed in standard size, it would have become very cramped. So I needed a solution.

To gain space, I built a bunk bed. The existing bed serves as the lower bunk. The rails from the old IKEA toddler bed were reused. The entire bed is anchored to the wall with 2 screws and is self-supporting.
