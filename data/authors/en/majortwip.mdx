Im a versatile maker/engineer with a passion for building and reverse engineering every kind of systems, 
from small embedded sensors with different transmission protocols to small MS Domains, virtualised and bare metal.
I think the most interesting projects are the electromechanical ones though, where I can combine the best of both worlds.
